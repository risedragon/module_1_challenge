## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
. Tthere are more success stories in May.
. In December, the number of successful cases was almost the same as the number of failed cases.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
When the goal is lower than 1000, the probability of success is greater than the probability of failure. As the goal amount increases, the success rate decreases. When the goal is greater than 20000, the probability of success is less than the probability of failure. When the target is between 35,000 and 45,000, the success rate is also greater than the failure rate, but there are only 6 cases in this interval. When the goal is greater than 45,000, the success rate is very low.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
